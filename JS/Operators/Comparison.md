<h1>Long Descriptions</h1>
<h2>Equal to</h2>
The equality operator (<code>==</code>) use the Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm to compare two operands.
<h2>Equal value and equal type</h2>
The strict equality operator (<code>===</code>) use the Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm to compare two operands.
<h2>Not Equal to</h2>
The inequality operator (<code>!=</code>) checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the strict inequality operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.
<h2>Not equal value or not equal type</h2>
The strict inequality operator (<code>!==</code>) checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the inequality operator, the strict inequality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.
<h2>Greater than</h2>
The greater than operator (<code>&gt;</code>) returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand, and false otherwise.
<h2>Less than</h2>
The less than operator (<code>&lt;</code>) returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand, and false otherwise.
<h2>Greater than or equal</h2>
The greater than or equal operator (<code>&gt;=</code>) returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand, and false otherwise.
<h2>Less than or equal</h1>
The less than or equal operator (<code>&lt;=</code>) returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand, and false otherwise.
<h2>Ternary</h2>
The ternary operator (also called 'the conditional operator') is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (<code>?</code>), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (<code>:</code>), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.
