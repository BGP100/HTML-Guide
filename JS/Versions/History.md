JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.
<br>
It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
<br>
After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).
<br>
Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

<h1>The ECMA Technical Committee 39</h1>
In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.
<br>
ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.
<h1>From ES4 to ES6</h1>
When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps:
<br>
<b>The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp:</b>
<br>
Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.
<br>
<b>The ECMAScript 4 Camp:</b>
<br>
Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.
<br>
August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email:
<br>
It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.
<br>
The solution was to work together:
<ul>
  <li>ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5</li>
  <li>ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.</li>
  <li>Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.</li>
  <li>TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.</li>
  <li>The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Browser Support</h1>
ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully compliant by July 2013:
<table class="ws-table-all notranslate">
  <tr>
    <th>Browser</th>
    <th>Chrome</th>
    <th>Edge</th>
    <th>Firefox</th>
    <th>Safari</th>
    <th>Opera</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Version</td>
    <td>23.0</td>
    <td>10.0</td>
    <td>21.0</td>
    <td>6.0</td>
    <td>15.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>
ES6 was also a huge success. It was released in 2015, and all major browsers were fully compliant by March 2017:
<table class="ws-table-all notranslate">
  <tr>
    <th>Browser</th>
    <th>Chrome</th>
    <th>Edge</th>
    <th>Firefox</th>
    <th>Safari</th>

    <td>Version</td>
    <td>51.0</td>
    <td>14.0</td>
    <td>52.0</td>
