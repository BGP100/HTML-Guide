<h1>What is it?</h1>
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
<br>
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
<br>
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
<br>
jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
<br>
The jQuery library contains the following features:
<ul>
  <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
  <li>CSS manipulation</li>
  <li>HTML event methods</li>
  <li>Effects and animations</li>
  <li>AJAX</li>
  <li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
<b>Tip:</b> In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.
<h1>Why jQuery?</h1>
There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.
<br>
Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:
<ul>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Microsoft</li>
  <li>IBM</li>
  <li>Netflix</li>
</ul>
<b>Will jQuery work in all browsers?</b>
<br>
The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.
