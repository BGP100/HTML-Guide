A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.
<br>
In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:
<br>
<b>#rrggbb</b>
<br>
Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
<br>
For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.
<br>
Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.
<br>
To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000 (if all digits are the same, you can put only 3 digits; #000)
<br>
To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.
