HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
<pre>&lt;!-- Write your comments here --&gt;</pre>
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.
<br>
With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
<pre>
&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Remember to add more information here --&gt;
</pre>
You can also hide more than one line, everything between the &lt;!-- and the --&gt; will be hidden from the display.
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
&lt;p&gt;Look at this cool image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli"&gt;
-->
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph too.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.
<br>
Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
<pre>
<p>This &lt;!-- great text --&gt; is a paragraph.</p>
</pre>
