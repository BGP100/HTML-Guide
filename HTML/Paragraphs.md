You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
<br>
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
<br>
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
<br>
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
<h1>Example:</h1>

&lt;p&gt;
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
&lt;/p&gt;
