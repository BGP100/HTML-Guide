Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.
<br>
However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).
<br>
We believe in that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
<br>
Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.
<h1>NotePad</h1>
<b>Windows 8 or later:</b>
<br>
Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.
<p></p>
<b>Windows 7 or earlier:</b>
<br>
Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad
<h1>TextEdit</h1>
Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit
<br>
Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"
<br>
Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".
<br>
Then open a new document to place the code.
<h1>Write some code</h1>
Write HTML code into Notepad like in the image:

<h1>Save the HTML</h1>
Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.
<br>
Name the file "index.htm" and set the encoding to UTF-8. (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files)
<h1>View on browser</h1>
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser. (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with")
<br>
The result will look much like this:
