The <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
<br>
The most important attribute of the <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> element is the <b>href</b> attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
<br>
By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
<ul>
  <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
  <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
  <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
</ul>
<pre>&lt;a href="https://github.com/BGP100/"&gt;Visit my Profile!&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<h1>Tips &amp; Notes</h1>

<br>
<b>Tip:</b> A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target.
