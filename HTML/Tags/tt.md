The <b>&lt;strike&gt;</b> tag was used in HTML 4 to define strikethrough text.
<br>
By this, I mean that this tag is not supported in the current version.
<br>
<b>Tip:</b> tt means "teletype text", like monospace.
<h1>What to do?</h1>
Use CSS instead.
<pre>
tt.lucida-console {
  font-family: "Lucida Console", monospace;
}
</pre>
