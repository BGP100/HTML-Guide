The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers.
<br>
You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code.
<pre>
&lt;!-- This is a comment. Comments are not displayed in the browser --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<h1>Tips &amp; Notes</h1>
You can use the comment tag to "hide" scripts from browsers without support for scripts (so they don't show them as plain text):
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;!--
function displayMsg() {
  alert("Hello World!")
}
//--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> The two forward slashes at the end of comment line (//) is the JavaScript comment symbol. This prevents JavaScript from executing the --&gt; tag.
<h1>Standard</h1>
The comment tag does not support any standard attributes.
<h1>Event</h1>
The comment tag does not support any event attributes.
