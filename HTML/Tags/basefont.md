The <b>&lt;basefonat&gt;</b> tag was used in HTML 4 to specify a default text-color, font-size or font-family for all the text in an HTML document.
<br>
By this, I mean that this tag is not supported in the current version.
<h1>What to do?</h1>
Specify a default text-color for a page (with CSS):
<pre>
body {
  color: red;
}
</pre>
