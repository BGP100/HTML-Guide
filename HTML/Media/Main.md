Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.
<h1>What is it?</h1>
Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.
<br>
Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.
<h1>Browser Support</h1>
The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.
<br>
Later came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedia!
<br>
<b><i>Note:</i></b> In Opera, <b>mp4</b> and <b>mp3</b> (video and audio) cannot be shown, so that's why <b>ogg</b> files exist!
<h1>Formats</h1>
Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.
<br>
The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.
<br>
Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.
