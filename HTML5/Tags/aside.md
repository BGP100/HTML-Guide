The <b>&lt;aside&gt;</b> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.
<br>
The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
<br>
<b>Tip:</b> The <b>&lt;aside&gt;</b> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
<br>
<b>Note:</b> The <b>&lt;aside&gt;</b> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <b>&lt;aside&gt;</b> element (see example below).
