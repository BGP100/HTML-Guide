CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.
<h1>What is it?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
  <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
  <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
  <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Why Use it?</h1>
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
<pre>
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}
p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
</pre>
<h1>CSS Solved a BIG Problem</h1>
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
<br>
HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
<br>
&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
<br>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>
When tags like <b>&lt;font&gt;</b>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
<br>
To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
<br>
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
<h1>CSS Saves a LOT of Work</h1>
The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
<br>
With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
