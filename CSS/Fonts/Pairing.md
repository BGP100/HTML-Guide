Great font pairings are essential to great design.
<h1>Pairing Rules</h1>
Here are some basic rules to create great font pairings:
<h2>1. Complement</h2>
It is always safe to find font pairings that complement one another.
<br>
A great font combination should harmonize, without being too similar or too different.
<h2>2. Use Font Superfamilies</h2>
A font superfamily is a set of fonts designed to work well together. So, using different fonts within the same superfamily is safe.
<br>
For example, the Lucida superfamily contains the following fonts: Lucida Sans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif and Lucida Math.
<h2>3. Contrast is King</h2>
Two fonts that are too similar will often conflict. However, contrasts, done the right way, brings out the best in each font.
<br>
Example: Combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination.
<br>
A strong superfamily includes both serif and sans serif variations of the same font (e.g. Lucida and Lucida Sans).
<h2>4. Choose Only One Boss</h2>
One font should be the boss. This establishes a hierarchy for the fonts on your page. This can be achieved by varying the size, weight and color.
<pre>
body {
  background-color: black;
  font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: gray; 
}
h1 {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  font-size: 60px;
  color: white;
}
</pre>
<h1>Popular Google Font Pairings</h1>
