The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
<br>
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
