An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
<br>
An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel. (opacity)
<br>
In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:
<br>
<b>rgb(red, green, blue)</b>
<br>
Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.
<br>
This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
<br>
For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.
<br>
Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0.
<br>
To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
<br>
To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).
<br>
Experiment by watching the RGB values below:

<h1>RGBA</h1>
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
<br>
An RGBA color value is specified with:
<br>
rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
<br>
The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).
