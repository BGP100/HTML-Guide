HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
<br>
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).
<br>
In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:
<br>
<b>hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)</b>
<br>
Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
<br>
Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
<br>
Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.
<br>
Experiment by watching the HSL values below:

<h1>Saturation</h1>
Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.
<br>
100% is pure color, no shades of gray
<br>
50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
<br>
0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.
<h1>Lightness</h1>
The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) 100% means full lightness (white).
<h1>HSLA</h1>
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
<br>
An HSLA color value is specified with:
<br>
<b>hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)</b>
<br>
The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
<br>
Experiment by mixing the HSLA values on your HTML NotePad or TextEdit!
