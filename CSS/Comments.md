Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
<br>
Comments are ignored by browsers.
<br>
A CSS comment is placed inside the <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> element, and starts with <code>/&#42;</code> and ends with <code>&#42;/</code>:
<pre>
/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}
</pre>
You can add comments wherever you want in the code:
<pre>
p {
  color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
}
</pre>
Comments can also span multiple lines:
<pre>
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */
p {
  color: red;
}
</pre>
